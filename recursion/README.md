# Ruby Recursion Exercises

These exercises are designed to complement the [Recursive Methods lesson in the Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-recursive-methods) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Each folder contains exercises and specs (tests) to work through.

### Set up local environment (optional)
1. Before you keep going, check out the [General README](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/ruby-exercises/blob/main/README.md) to follow up the setup ruby instructions for running it locally.

### Usage

1. First change directory into the lesson directory, for example `cd 1_factorial`.
2. Run the command `rspec` to run the tests. The first test will fail and the rest will be skipped.
3. Open that corresponding exercise file in your text editor, in this case the `exercises/factorial.rb` file.
4. Write the code to get the failing test to pass in the exercise file and run the tests again to verify it passes.
5. Each `exercises` folder has a corresponding `spec` folder with matching test files. For instance, you can find the tests for `exercises/factorial.rb` in `spec/factorial_spec.rb`. Find and open the matching spec file.
6. Unskip the next test by removing the `x` from `xit`.
7. Run your tests again using `rspec`. The second test should now be failing.
8. Repeat the steps from step 2 until no more tests are skipped and all are passing.
