# Ruby Testing Exercises
These exercises are designed to compliment the Ruby Testing lessons from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

### Usage

1. Navigate to a lesson directory, for example `cd ruby_testing/1_rspec_basics`.
2. Run the tests for the first exercise file, for example `bundle exec rspec spec/1_eq_matcher_spec.rb. **No examples should be found, because it is your turn to write the tests!**
3. Open the exercise spec file in your text editor.
4. Follow the instructions in the file to write **one** test.
5. Run the tests again to verify it passes before moving on to the next test.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5, until you written all tests in a file.
7. If there are additional exercise spec files in the lesson directory, repeat steps 1-6 for each file.
