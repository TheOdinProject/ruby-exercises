# Ruby Basics Exercises

These exercises are designed to compliment the [Ruby Basic lessons](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming#basic-ruby) on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Each folder contains exercises and specs(tests) for the lessons in the Ruby Basics section.

### Usage

1. First change directory into the lesson directory, for example `cd 1_data_types`.
2. Run the tests for an exercise file, for example `bundle exec rspec spec/numbers_exercises_spec.rb`. The first test will fail and the rest will be skipped.
3. Open that corresponding exercise file in your text editor, in this case the `exercises/numbers_exercises.rb` file.
4. Write the code to get the failing test to pass in the exercise file and run the tests again to verify it passes.
5. Go into the test file and unskip the next test by removing the `x` from `xit`.
6. Run your tests again `bundle exec rspec spec/numbers_exercises_spec.rb` the second test should now be failing.
7. Repeat the steps from step 2 until no more tests are skipped and all are passing.

**TIP**: When there is only one exercise file in a directory (such as in `6_arrays`) you can omit the path to the file and just enter `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests in that file.
